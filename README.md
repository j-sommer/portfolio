## Description

This project uses [Angular 9](https://angular.io/) as its frontend framework and an [AWS Lambda Function](https://aws.amazon.com/de/lambda/) as an API. The AWS Lambda Function and the whole Continous Deployment was set up via [AWS Amplify](https://aws.amazon.com/de/amplify/).

## Testing

The frontend uses [Jest](https://jestjs.io/) for the unit testing and [Testcaf√®](https://devexpress.github.io/testcafe/) for the e2e testing.
